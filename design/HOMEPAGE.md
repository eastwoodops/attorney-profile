# Homepage Composition & Trust Strategy

**Goal:** Convert sophisticated clients by establishing immediate competence and authority.

## 1. The Sequence (Psychological Flow)

The homepage is an argument, not a brochure. It follows the structure of a legal opening statement.

1.  **The Hook (HERO):** State the case. "We handle appeals and complex disputes." No ambiguity.
2.  **The Credentials (TRUST BAR):** Prove standing. Show court admissions immediately to filter for seriousness.
3.  **The Philosophy (AUTHORITY):** Differentiate. "We are document-driven." This filters out clients looking for "pitbulls" and attracts those looking for "surgeons."
4.  **The Facts (PRACTICE GRID):** Scope. "Do you solve X?" The user scans for their specific issue.
5.  **The Witness (BIO):** Humanize. "Who is handling my file?"
6.  **The Rebuttal (FAQ):** Address fears. Cost, time, odds.
7.  **The Ask (CONTACT):** Closing. "Let's review the record."

## 2. Trust Signals (The "Premium" cues)

Sophisticated legal clients (business owners, other lawyers) evaluate credibility differently than consumer clients.

*   **Visual Cues:**
    *   **Serif Headings:** Signal tradition and literacy.
    *   **Desaturated Colors:** Signal restraint. Bright colors signal "sales."
    *   **Symmetry:** Signals stability.

*   **Content Signals:**
    *   **Precision:** "300+ Briefs Filed" is better than "Experienced."
    *   **Vocabulary:** Using correct legal terminology (e.g., "Post-Trial Motions," "Quiet Title") signals that we are speaking to peers/adults, not simplifying for children.

*   **Layout Signals:**
    *   **Whitespace:** Only expensive brands can afford to waste space.
    *   **No Pop-ups:** We do not interrupt the client. We wait for them.

## 3. What to AVOID (The Anti-Pattern)

*   **"We Fight For You":** Generic, low-value commodity language.
*   **Stock Photos of Handshakes:** Implies a lack of real clients or real office.
*   **"Free Consultation" Buttons everywhere:** Smells of desperation. Use "Case Evaluation" or "Discuss Your Appeal" at strategic points only.
*   **Badges:** No "Top 100 Lawyers" generic badges. They look cheap to sophisticated buyers. Only use verified Bar Association or Court admission seals.
