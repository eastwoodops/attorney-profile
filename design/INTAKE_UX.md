# Contact & Intake UX Psychology

**Goal:** Convert high-value clients by reducing anxiety and signaling exclusivity.

## 1. The "Velvet Rope" Philosophy

We are not trying to get *everyone* to fill out the form. We are inviting *qualified* clients to request a review.
*   **Shift:** From "Contact Us" (Generic) to "Request Case Review" (Specific Value).
*   **Tone:** We do not beg. We offer a professional service to those who need it.

## 2. Microcopy Strategy: Authority vs. Sales

*   **Avoid:** "Free Consultation", "Get Help Now", "We Fight For You".
*   **Use:** "Confidential Review", "Discuss Your Appeal", "Secure Transmission".
*   **Reasoning:** Sophisticated clients value privacy and competence over "freebies."

## 3. Friction vs. Qualification

A form with zero friction (just email) invites spam. A form with too much friction (10 pages) causes abandonment.
*   **The Goldilocks Barrier:** We ask for *just enough* to prove the user is serious (e.g., "Case Type", "Brief Description").
*   **Inputs:** Use visual weight (underlines, borders) to make filling the form feel "official," like signing a document.

## 4. Visual Trust Indicators

Anxiety is high when contacting a lawyer. We reduce it with:
*   **The Lock Icon:** Explicitly mentioning "Encrypted" or "Privileged".
*   **The Face:** Showing the attorney (or office) near the form to remind them there is a human on the other side.
*   **Direct Access:** Always offering a phone number as an alternative. "Call us if you prefer."

## 5. Success State

*   **Avoid:** "Thanks! We'll get back to you." (Too casual).
*   **Use:** "Request Received. We will review your information and contact you within 24 hours." (Professional commitment).
