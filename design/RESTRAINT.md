# Visual Restraint Guidelines: Alderman Law Firm

**Goal:** Prevent visual noise. Credibility comes from what we *remove*, not what we add.

## 1. Color Usage: The 60-30-10 Rule

We do not use color to "delight." We use it to direct attention.

*   **60% Surface (Legal Paper):** The canvas. Warm, static, calm.
*   **30% Ink (Navy/Charcoal):** The content. High contrast, authoritative.
*   **10% Gold (Antique Bronze):** The seal. Used *only* for:
    *   Hairline borders
    *   Primary Buttons
    *   Active states
    *   H4 Eyebrows

**Strict Prohibitions:**
*   NO gradients.
*   NO using Gold for body text.
*   NO "bright" interaction colors (e.g., green for success). Success is Navy.

## 2. Imagery: "The Evidence"

Legal work is abstract. We ground it with texture, not metaphors.

*   **Allowed Subjects:**
    *   **Textures:** High-quality paper grain, leather bindings, architectural stone, fountain pen ink.
    *   **Architecture:** Courthouses (abstract angles), library stacks.
    *   **Portraits:** Black & white or highly desaturated. Serious, approachable, looking at the camera.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Low saturation.
    *   High contrast.
    *   No "blue filters."

**Strict Prohibitions:**
*   NO "Gavel on Sound Block."
*   NO "Shaking Hands."
*   NO "Scales of Justice" 3D renders.
*   NO Generic "Boardroom Meeting" stock.

## 3. Iconography: Precision Instruments

Icons are navigation aids, not illustrations.

*   **Style:** Stroke (Outline). 1.5px weight.
*   **Tone:** Clinical, sharp, architectural.
*   **Library:** Lucide React (or similar).
*   **Color:** Charcoal or Navy. Never Gold (unless active).

**Strict Prohibitions:**
*   NO Filled icons.
*   NO Multicolor icons.
*   NO "Cartoon" proportions.

## 4. Animation & Interaction: "Heavy Paper"

The site should feel like a physical object—solid, heavy, permanent.

*   **Transitions:** Slow fades (duration: 300ms-500ms).
*   **Hover States:** Subtle color shifts (Navy -> Charcoal) or 1px underline expansion.
*   **Movement:** None. Elements do not "fly in." They *appear*.

**Strict Prohibitions:**
*   NO Bouncing buttons.
*   NO Parallax scrolling.
*   NO Scroll-jacking.
*   NO Loading spinners (unless absolutely necessary for data).

## 5. UI Elements

*   **Shadows:** Avoid. Use 1px borders for separation. If shadows are needed for layering, use tight, dark, low-blur shadows (simulating paper on a desk).
*   **Corners:** Sharp (0px radius) or Micro (2px radius). No "Pill" buttons.
*   **Borders:** Hairlines (1px). Elegant, precise.
