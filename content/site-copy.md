## 2. Record-Driven Advocacy
**Intro:**
My practice is dedicated to stages of litigation where the outcome turns on the written record. I partner with trial counsel to ensure the legal theory is preserved, articulated, and persuasive.

**Services List:**
*   01 Appeals in Colorado appellate courts and the Tenth Circuit
*   02 Issue preservation and error analysis
*   03 Record review and procedural strategy
*   04 Brief drafting and motion practice
*   05 Post-trial and post-judgment motions
*   06 Advisory/consulting support to trial counsel
*   07 Dispositive and contract-based briefing

**Quote:**
"Many matters are not yet on appeal; I am often brought in to evaluate the record, frame issues, or assist with briefing before or after judgment. I do not co-chair on trial-level litigation or ongoing case management; my role is limited to appellate, briefing, and discrete litigation consulting."

## 3. How Referrals Work
I can appear as counsel of record or work in a consulting capacity. Trial counsel may remain involved as desired. Consults may be limited to discrete procedural questions or extend through full briefing.

I also work with out-of-state attorneys, including Wisconsin, in a consulting or drafting capacity. In trial-level matters, local counsel remains counsel of record and I assist with research, issue analysis, and briefing.

## 5. Bio / Approach
My practice focuses on record-driven litigation—the work that wins or loses on a clear, persuasive written argument. I work with trial counsel and parties to evaluate appellate options, frame issues for appeal, and draft briefs and motions that courts actually read.

Most of my work involves collaborating with trial counsel who remain closely involved in the case. I bring appellate perspective to trial strategy and procedural choices, and I handle the specialized work of motion drafting and record analysis that trial lawyers often need to outsource.
