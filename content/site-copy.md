## 1. Hero Function Statement
**H1:** Kimberly Rufe
**Sub:** Appellate Counsel & Briefing Support

**Intro Note:**
This page is intended for attorneys with a ruling, adverse order, or appeal-deadline concern.

**Primary Text:**
I typically serve as counsel on appeal, handling issue evaluation, briefing, and appellate procedure. For trial matters, I provide drafting and research support only. Referring counsel remains counsel of record unless appellate representation is requested. Most matters arise after a ruling or deadline concern. Email is preferred, and attaching the order or relevant filing allows prompt review.

## 2. When to Involve Appellate Counsel
**Intro:**
Attorneys typically contact me when a case raises appellate or record-related concerns, including:

**List:**
*   Appeals in Colorado and federal appellate courts

*   Trial-stage involvement limited to preservation, drafting, and appellate strategy

## 3. Working With Referring Counsel
Referring counsel remains lead counsel in the matter. I assist with appellate and record-related issues, including issue evaluation, preservation, and briefing. My role may be limited to consultation or extend through full briefing and, when requested, an appearance on appeal. I do not contact or bill the client directly unless requested by referring counsel.

I also work with attorneys in other jurisdictions, including Wisconsin. Local counsel remains counsel of record while I provide research, analysis, and drafting support.
